```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rso-framework.git
cd rso-framework

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv rso-env
source rso-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rso-env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests to verify setup
python -m pytest tests/
python src/make_figures.py
