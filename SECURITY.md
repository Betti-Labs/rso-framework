# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the RSO Framework:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The RSO Framework is designed with security in mind, but we take all security concerns seriously.

### What to Report

Please report any security vulnerabilities you discover, including:

- **Input validation bypasses** that could lead to code injection
- **Resource exhaustion attacks** through malicious input parameters
- **Information disclosure** through error messages or logging
- **Denial of service** vulnerabilities in recursive operations
- **Dependency vulnerabilities** in third-party packages

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Email**: [Create a GitHub issue with "SECURITY" label for now]
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] RSO Framework Vulnerability Report

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Within 2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### Security Measures

The RSO Framework implements several security measures:

#### Input Validation
- **Type checking** for all function parameters
- **Range validation** for numeric inputs
- **Identifier validation** for predicate names
- **Depth limits** to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Resource Protection
- **Configurable depth limits** for recursive operations
- **Memory usage monitoring** and cleanup
- **Timeout protection** for long-running operations
- **Safe evaluation** without arbitrary code execution

#### Error Handling
- **Sanitized error messages** that don't leak sensitive information
- **Graceful failure modes** that don't crash the system
- **Logging controls** to prevent information disclosure
- **Exception hierarchy** for proper error categorization

#### Dependencies
- **Minimal dependencies** to reduce attack surface
- **Version pinning** for reproducible builds
- **Regular updates** of security-critical dependencies
- **Vulnerability scanning** of dependency tree

### Security Best Practices for Users

When using the RSO Framework:

1. **Validate Input**: Always validate user input before passing to RSO functions
2. **Set Limits**: Use appropriate depth limits for recursive operations
3. **Monitor Resources**: Monitor memory and CPU usage in production
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep the framework updated to the latest version
5. **Isolate Execution**: Run RSO operations in isolated environments when processing untrusted input

### Known Security Considerations

#### Computational Complexity
- **Exponential growth**: Xi operator complexity grows exponentially with depth
- **Memory usage**: Large attractors can consume significant memory
- **Mitigation**: Use depth limits and monitor resource usage

#### Symbolic Computation
- **Expression complexity**: Complex symbolic expressions can be computationally expensive
- **Memory leaks**: SymPy expressions may accumulate in memory
- **Mitigation**: Regular cleanup and expression simplification

#### Recursive Operations
- **Stack overflow**: Deep recursion could potentially cause stack overflow
- **Infinite loops**: Malformed input could cause infinite recursion
- **Mitigation**: Depth limits and iterative implementations where possible

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private reporting** of vulnerabilities
2. **Coordinated disclosure** with affected parties
3. **Public disclosure** only after fixes are available
4. **Credit** to security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- **Prioritized** over feature development
- **Released promptly** after validation
- **Clearly marked** in release notes
- **Backwards compatible** when possible

### Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **Security Issues**: Create GitHub issue with "SECURITY" label
- **General Contact**: Create GitHub issue or discussion
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-security bugs only

Thank you for helping keep the RSO Framework secure!
