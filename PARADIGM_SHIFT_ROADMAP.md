## Call to Action

The RSO framework represents a fundamental shift in how we understand reality and computation. To achieve paradigm-shifting impact, we need:

1. **Mathematicians** to formalize and verify the theoretical foundations
2. **Computer Scientists** to build scalable, high-performance implementations
3. **Physicists** to design and execute empirical validation experiments
4. **Philosophers** to explore the metaphysical implications
5. **Practitioners** to develop real-world applications

Join us in building the future of contradiction-based computing and reality understanding.
