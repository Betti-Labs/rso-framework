# Recursive Superpositional Ontology (RSO) Laboratory

Welcome to the **RSO Laboratory**, an open repository for exploring the
metaphysical and symbolic logic framework introduced in _Reality as
Recursion: A Symbolic Framework for Contradiction‑Based Existence_.

This repository accompanies the scientific paper written by
**Gregory Betti (Betti Labs)** and contains reproducible code,
visualisations, and documentation needed to investigate the
**Recursive Superpositional Ontology (RSO)**.  The lab is organised
around the idea that reality is not composed of resolved states but of
recursive contradictions captured by the operator ⊕ and its
associated contradiction field Ξ.

## Philosophy

RSO begins from a radical ontological axiom: **every property \(x\)
coexists with its negation \(¬x\)**.  Rather than treating the
contradiction \(x ∧ ¬x\) as an impossibility, RSO elevates it to a
fundamental ingredient of being.  The universe is described as a
superposition of every predicate and its opposite, generating a
network of **Ξ‑nodes** that constantly loop between states.  This
recursion is not a failure of logic; it is the engine of existence.

### Key Principles

* **Contradiction‑preserving superposition (⊕):** A binary operator that
  combines a predicate with its negation without resolving their
  opposition.  Iterating ⊕ generates a **Ξ attractor**, a symbolic
  structure containing all variations of \(x\) and \(¬x\).
* **Ξ fields:** The self‑referential sets resulting from the ⊕
  operation.  Each Ξ contains the predicate, its negation, their
  conjunction, and further nested superpositions.  Ξ‑graphs visualise
  these structures as loops with tension arrows.
* **Recursion as reality:** Time, space, matter, and consciousness
  emerge from the velocities and orientations of Ξ cycles.  Nothing
  ultimately collapses—every collapse is a local projection of a
  deeper recursion.

For philosophical context, RSO resonates with ideas from **Heraclitus**
(unity of opposites and flux), **Daoist yin–yang** (interdependence of
contrary forces), and modern **paraconsistent logics** that reject
explosion in the presence of contradictions【800088766790706†L41-L54】.  It also echoes the
**many‑worlds interpretation** of quantum mechanics, which removes
wave function collapse and treats the universe as an ever‑branching
superposition【751751222457522†L457-L464】.  These influences underscore
the plausibility of a reality built on recursive contradiction.

### `figures/`

The **figures** directory contains reproductions of the key diagrams
used in the paper.  They are generated programmatically by
`src/make_figures.py` and include:

* **xi_one_X.(png|pdf)** – one‑predicate Ξ graph showing the loop
  between \(x\), \(¬x\), and the contradictory state \(x∧¬x\).
* **xi_two_X_Y.(png|pdf)** – two‑predicate Ξ² graph illustrating the
  richer structure of combining predicates \(x\) and \(y\).
* **contradiction_lattice.(png|pdf)** – lattice of the four truth
  values (True, False, Both, Neither) highlighting the legitimacy of
  the “Both” state in paraconsistent reasoning.
* **recursive_orbit.(png|pdf)** – continuous oscillation representing
  a recursive orbit.
* **hot_cold_simulation.(png|pdf)** – discrete toy model toggling
  between hot and cold states.

### `src/`

* **`xi.py`** – Implements the `XiOscillator` class for discrete
  oscillations, the `XiSymbolic` class for symbolic predicates using
  SymPy, and the `xi_operator` function to build finite
  approximations to Ξ fields.
* **`make_figures.py`** – Generates all diagrams in the `figures`
  directory.  It uses only `matplotlib` primitives so that no
  external graph library is required.

### `notebooks/`

* **`xi_simulation.ipynb`** – A short Jupyter notebook acting as a
  **Ξ playground**.  It demonstrates how to create an oscillator,
  iterate its states, and construct symbolic contradiction fields.

## Testable Predictions

The RSO framework makes several qualitative predictions that can be
investigated computationally:

1. **Stability thresholds:** A Ξ attractor remains stable only if the
   recursion is continued indefinitely.  If the oscillation is
   interrupted or one state is favoured, a “collapse” occurs.  Simple
   models, such as the hot/cold simulation in this repository, can
   explore how long it takes for such interruptions to occur under
   perturbations.
2. **Emergent time:** The period of oscillation in a Ξ cycle defines
   an emergent temporal scale.  Simulations of coupled oscillators may
   exhibit phase synchronisation that resembles thermodynamic or
   causal arrows of time.
3. **Composite attractors:** Combining predicates via Ξ² should yield
   richer dynamics, potentially displaying quasi‑periodic or chaotic
   behaviour.  One can numerically explore these multi‑predicate
   systems by extending `XiOscillator` to more than one dimension.

## Getting Started

#### Python API

```python
from src.xi import XiOscillator, XiSymbolic, xi_operator

# Create and run oscillator
oscillator = XiOscillator(True)
history = oscillator.iterate(10)
print(f"Oscillation: {history}")

# Create symbolic predicate and Xi attractor
predicate = XiSymbolic('Consciousness')
attractor = xi_operator(predicate, depth=2)
print(f"Xi attractor has {len(attractor)} expressions")

# Validate the attractor
from src.xi import validate_xi_attractor
validation = validate_xi_attractor(attractor, predicate)
print(f"Validation passed: {validation['validation_passed']}")
```
